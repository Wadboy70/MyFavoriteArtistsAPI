        "description": "Kim Jung Gi is amazing artist born in the town of Goyang-Si, located in the province of Kyongki-Do South Korea in 1975. Jung Gi attended Dong-Eui University in Busan for three years and did his two years in the South Korean army as a part of the Special Forces Unit.  Here, he was able to memorize the array of different weapons and vehicles. Kimâ€™s most notable creative asset is his memory, something he has developed over a number of years.  His ability to render extremely complicated scenes near-perfectly from memory, without the aid of references, has stretched the boundaries of what many artists believed was possible.",
